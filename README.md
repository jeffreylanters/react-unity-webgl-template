# React Unity WebGL Test 🎢

Hi there and welcome to the React Unity WebGL Test repository!

In this repository you'll find everything you'll need for testing and playing with the React Unity WebGL module. This repository is buildt using Create React App for a most basic boilerplate. Among this you'll find three directories;

- "src" Containing the React Application here for you to test and modify
- "public" Containing the Static assets which includes the Unity WebGL build
- "unity_project" Containing the Raw Unity Project (not required but here for demo purposes)

**Important** The React Unity WebGL module is NOT provided in this repository and should be build manually. For more details on building the module please head over to the React Unity WebGL [Documentation](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl#contribution-and-development) for further details on contribution, development and testing. If you don't want to do this yourself, simply remove react-unity-webgl entry from the package.json and install it using `npm install react-unity-webgl`.

Head over to the module repository to open [Issues](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/issues) and held [discussions](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/discussions).

Happy coding!
