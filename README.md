This repository contains a template for integrating Unity WebGL builds into React applications. It provides a seamless way to embed Unity content within React components, allowing developers to leverage the power of both technologies.

This template is designed to be used as a starting point for projects that require Unity WebGL integration, offering a structured setup with essential configurations and workflows. It includes a small example Unity project to demonstrate the integration process.
